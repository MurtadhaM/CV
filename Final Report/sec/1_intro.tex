Attendance is an indispensable metric for a student's academic journey, where consistent participation correlates with academic success. The process of monitoring and maintaining attendance records presents significant challenges, which mostly originates from constraints in time and resources. By harnessing the benefits of computer vision, this project addresses the problem of automating the attendance-taking process in classrooms using a tool that is at every teacherâ€™s disposal, their cell phone camera.
