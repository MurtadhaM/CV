\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

This section will outline the results of our efforts in this project including the metrics of the model itself and an example of it's working state. \\

Prior to loading any images, we implemented a pre-processing step to stitch images to ensure that all the images are the same size. The images were stitched together using the OpenCV. \\

After the image is pre-processed, it is fed into the model. The image below shows the image before it is fed into the model. \\

The image below shows the results of the model. The model was trained for 100 epochs and the loss was 0.0001. The model that was used was pre-trained on yolov6-n variant of the YOLO family. \\
