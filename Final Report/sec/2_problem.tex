\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}
Attendance enforcement and record keeping in the class room is often overlooked because of added time and resources. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to enforce attendance in the classroom. In this project, we will develop a system that will allow students to check in and out of a classroom using face recognition. \\
