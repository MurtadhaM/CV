\section{Data}
1. The data for this project will be collected from the University of North Carolina's Canvas API (Will use Murtadha's Account) to fetch the number of students in the Computer Vision course. This information will be stored to be references to give a percentage of students attending.\\
2. The dataset that will be used to train our model is the \href{http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/}{\underline{Faces in the Wild (LFW)}} dataset. This dataset contains more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web. Each face has been labeled with the name of the person pictured. 1680 of the people pictured have two or more distinct photos in the dataset. The only constraint on these faces is that they were detected by the Viola{-}Jones face detector.\\
3. Images of the students in the class will be collected using a webcam. The images will be taken in the classroom and will be used to train the model to recognize the students in the class.\\
